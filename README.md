## A project to track work orders for my job. 

I want to create an application that will replace printing out a lot of work orders,
normally I print reports or individual work orders which leads to a lot of paper and ink use.
Instead, it'd be nice to have this checklist be digital :)

# Finished:
## v1
* Import data through clean csv
* Set up express server, able to view via browser
* Allow data change, mark wo as complete

## v2
* Import RAW CSV export from workorder system
* Mobile friendly

# Plans for this:
## V3
* Users, multiple people tracking their own workorders
* Move from JSON to SQLite
